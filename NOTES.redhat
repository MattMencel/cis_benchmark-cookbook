This file contains additional notes about sections of the CIS Benchmark for Red Hat.

2.1 Apply Latest OS Patches

None of the recipes apply the latest OS patches. It is presumed the system administrator will do so using yum update during a regularly scheduled maintenance window, or on an ad hoc basis with knife. For example:

    knife ssh "platform:redhat" "sudo yum update -y"

However, some recipes may install packages using the "upgrade" action. Red Hat has a known reputation for only providing updates within a release cycle that are security fixes, and always maintaining backwards compatibility.
